 A little discord bot I made that is run ~~from my computer
 because I don't have the money to buy a VPS
 or other hosting service.~~ from glitch! So it's online 24/7 no wooho!

## Save APOD
To save your own astronomy pictures of the day
you will need to get an api key from nasa's website.
Then you will need to download [functions.py](functions.py)
and [save_APOD.py](save_APOD.py), you can then make your own `config.ini`
like this:

```
[credentials]
nasa_api_key = your_nasa_key
directory = path_to_your_directory
```
But then you will need to uncomment some lines in the code, I work with and .env file.
Or you can hardcode the key and path , I'm not your mom I can't tell you what to do.
